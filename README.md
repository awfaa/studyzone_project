## Title 
### StudyZone

## Introduction 
We developed a study planner for university students who have trouble managing their time. In order to help students simply keep track of their homework or deadlines, we are working on projects for them that will incorporate notes, flashcards, and class information. Study trackers were also added so that students could focus entirely on the assignments they wished to complete rather than getting distracted by other tasks.

## Objective 
This project's goal is to examine each person's preferred learning method and give an analysis on how much time the student can concentrate. Alternatively, to evaluate students' dedication. Make sure to block off time on the student calendar for all of their classes, obligations at work, and extracurricular activities. Additionally, students should schedule study time for each topic. It is to estimate how much time students will need to dedicate to each subject they wish to study. Furthermore, a student planner is used to create a schedule allowing them to choose which days they have available for study. Moreover, students can plan their study time according to their preferred methods of learning.

## Features and Functionalities 
* Homepage - Homepage welcomes user to the website after loging in and registrating process done.It also attract user to other pages; notes page, flashcard page, schedule page and study tracker page via hyperlinks.

* Notes - Notes page allows users to organize everything including to-do list,  summary of subjects, revisions, lecture notes and all other types of information with no messy folders. Users can navigate through the page to view, add, edit and delete notes by clicking the buttons. 

* Flashcard - This modul enable the user to get interactive with flashcard study method. By using this app, the user can perform CRUD operation on this app such as Create, Read, Update and Delete the Flashcard titles, description and the flashcards itself.  

* Schedule - In schedule, users can input  class information such as course code, subject, day and time, location. From there, it will showcase an overview of the week to keep users in check.
 
* Study Tracker - Users may get a graphic breakdown of  study hours using a timer. Users will quickly gain a better picture of how much time devote to each course or activity within the course if they keep track of study hours.

## Challenges and Difficulties in Developing
* Intializing the repository to have it editable by other team members in their own machine. We had to research Github's options on platforms to do so and faced many errors and unsynced data. Lastly, we found a way by using Github Desktop and cloning the project, then the leader uses Git Bash to commit and push to this page.

* First phase had a push and pull problem that affected the code everyone has, had to be solved by going through each file to check what went missing and what changes needed to be made.

* After code instillation, there were errors for other members to run, and only one managed to run on their machine succefully. So, the final localhost run has to be done by one member to view the outcome.

* Committing the code by other members that have database have problems with it not adding the change to other member's database page. So, have to import and share the finished SQL in order to run and view.

* Had a problem with the redirection of authentication features to the pages that were needed. (eg: Login page to redirect to homepage, or Logout page to redirect to Login page again)

* Had a problem in creating a new database and integrate it to the existing template that only use css and js.
